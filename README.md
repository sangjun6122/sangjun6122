## Research Focus

I study AI-based precision metrology and inspection systems grounded in real industrial equipment.
My research bridges physical processes, sensing, and deep learning, with a focus on:

- Learning-based surface & thin-film metrology
- Defect detection under severe noise, variation, and domain shift
- Hybrid systems combining physics, rules, and deep neural networks
- Translating research models into deployable, real-time equipment

Currently an M.S. candidate at Sungkyunkwan University, focusing on deep learning for surface metrology.

## Core Domains & Capabilities

### 1. Industrial AI & Machine Vision

- Deep learning–based defect detection & measurement
- Hybrid inspection: DL + rule-based + optical heuristics
- PyTorch, OpenCV, HALCON
- Dataset construction from real production equipment

### 2. Precision Metrology & Physical Systems

- Thin-film scratch, stress, tribology measurement
- Residual stress & magnetic field mapping
- Understanding of process-induced measurement uncertainty

### 3. System & Control Architecture

- End-to-end inspection equipment design
- Real-time motion control & synchronization
- C/C++ (MFC), Python, PLC-based systems
- Deployment under strict latency and reliability constraints

## What I Research Through Building

Rather than separating research and engineering,
I use production equipment as research platforms.

**Thin-Film Metrology Instruments**
Scratch tester, tribometer, stress analyzer
→ 40+ units deployed globally (ODM with Helmut Fischer, Germany)

**Plasma Surface Treatment Systems**
PECVD, PVD systems for electronics and automotive industries

**Roll-to-Roll Inspection Systems**
Cylindrical roll inspection for printed electronics and optical sheets
→ Deployed in domestic and international production lines

These systems provide real-world data, constraints, and failure modes
that directly inform my research.

## Selected Research & Patents

- **M.S. Research** – Deep Learning for Surface Metrology (Smart Factory Convergence, SKKU)
- **Apparatus for Detecting Defects** – Filed 2024, KR + PCT
- **Vision System for Gravure Roll Inspection** – Patent issued 2017

## Research Philosophy

Industrial AI is not about maximizing benchmark accuracy,
but about minimizing uncertainty under real constraints.

I focus on:

- Why models fail in production
- How physical processes shape data distributions
- How AI systems can be trusted on real equipment
